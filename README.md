# mining tools
My usually used data-mining tools can be found here.

## DLLFileExtractor
* extraction of unencrypted DLLs

## Protobuf
* generation of protocols for protobuf based on the extracted source code
    (more or less guarenteed results by using netReflector as dll decoder)

## ACB Converter
* converts (multiple) acb files to mp3
